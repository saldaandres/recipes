        <li>8 ounces cooked chicken (about 2 cups shredded)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
        <li>1/4 yellow onion, minced (about 1/3 cup)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) can mild green diced chilis</li>
        <li>More ingredients ...</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="ordered">
        <li>
            Shred the leftover chicken so it’s ready when you need it. You should have about 2 cups.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In a large, high-sided skillet set over medium heat, add the oil. Once the oil shimmers, add onion and garlic and cook for 1 minute, just until softened.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add tomato sauce, water, diced green chilis, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. Stir together, then let the sauce simmer on medium to medium-low while you assemble the enchiladas.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Put about 2 tablespoons of shredded chicken down the center of each tortilla. (You don’t really have to measure the meat. Just divide it evenly among the tortillas!) Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon cotija cheese (just eyeball it) across the chicken, and spoon 1-2 teaspoons sauce over the cheese.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fold in the sides of the tortilla, roll it up, and put it seam side down in the sauce. Nestle them in the pan. Repeat this until the pan is full. Spoon sauce over the top of the enchiladas.
